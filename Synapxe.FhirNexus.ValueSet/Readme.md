This repo demostrates how to setup the FHIRNexus ValueSet service. 

It defines two custom ValueSets `hsg-residential-status` and `hsg-organization-type`. Upon first time launching the service, the ValueSet database is created and populated with the custom ValueSet.

Refer to `valueset.http` for how to use the ValueSet service.
